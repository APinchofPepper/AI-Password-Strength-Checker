# AI Password Strength Checker 🔐🤖

A comprehensive password strength analysis tool that combines traditional security heuristics with machine learning models trained on real-world password breach data.

## 🎯 Overview

This project explores the intersection of adversarial AI and cybersecurity by implementing a dual-approach password strength evaluation system:

- **Rule-based Analysis**: Traditional security metrics including length, character complexity, and entropy calculations
- **AI/ML Classification**: Machine learning models trained on leaked password datasets (e.g., RockYou) to identify patterns and vulnerabilities

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Multi-layered Analysis**: Combines heuristic rules with ML predictions
- 📊 **Comprehensive Scoring**: Provides detailed breakdown of password weaknesses
- 🛡️ **Real-world Training**: Models trained on actual breach data for realistic assessments
- 🎨 **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly CLI with detailed reporting
- 📈 **Visualization Tools**: Charts and graphs to illustrate password strength factors

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1**: Implement rule-based scoring system
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Train and validate ML models on password datasets
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Build intuitive CLI interface
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Add comprehensive visualizations and reporting
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and advanced features

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Password-Strength-Checker.git
cd AI-Password-Strength-Checker

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download training data (instructions to be added)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run password strength analysis (example, coming soon)
python src/cli/main.py "your_password_here"

# Analyze multiple passwords from file (example, coming soon)
python src/cli/main.py --input passwords.txt --output results.json
```

## 📊 Example Output

```
Password: "password123"
├── Rule-based Score: 2/10
├── ML Prediction: WEAK (98% confidence)
├── Key Issues:
│   ├── Common dictionary word
│   ├── Sequential numbers
│   └── Low entropy (28.5 bits)
└── Recommendations:
    ├── Use mixed case letters
    ├── Include special characters
    └── Avoid common patterns
```

## 🔬 Methodology

### Rule-based Analysis
- Length requirements and penalties
- Character set diversity scoring
- Entropy calculations
- Common pattern detection
- Dictionary word checking

### Machine Learning Approach
- Feature engineering from password characteristics
- Training on real breach datasets
- Ensemble methods for robust predictions
- Confidence scoring for reliability assessment

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Performance metrics will be added once the machine learning models are trained and validated. Planned evaluations include metrics on validation sets from RockYou and other benchmark datasets:
- Accuracy
- Precision  
- Recall
- Processing Speed
